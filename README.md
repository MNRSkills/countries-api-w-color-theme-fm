## My process

- Install all the necessary tools, create-react-app, axios, and tailwindcss.
- I have a layout component and children as Navbar and Footer and all other children thank you.

### What I learned

Revisited Ternary Operators, a shorthand for if/else statements.

```js
let action = true;
let switch = action ? true : false
```

Pretty convenient. You can find my use case in the App file lines 126 - 130
